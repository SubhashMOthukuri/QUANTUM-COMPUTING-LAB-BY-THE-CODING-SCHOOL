# Qubit X Qubit Quantum Computing Classes

Welcome to the **Qubit X Qubit Quantum Computing Classes** repository! This repository contains resources and learning materials for a **two-semester** course on **Quantum Computing (QC)** using **Python** and **Cirq**.

## Course Overview

### **Semester 1: Foundations of Quantum Computing**
In this semester, students will be introduced to **Python programming** and **Cirq**, a quantum computing framework. The curriculum covers fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics, quantum gates, and quantum circuits. The focus will be on understanding:

- Basics of **Python** for quantum programming.
- Introduction to **Cirq** and setting up a quantum development environment.
- Understanding **qubits**, quantum superposition, and entanglement using light wave experiments.
- Exploring **quantum gates** (Hadamard, Pauli, CNOT, etc.).
- Constructing and running **quantum circuits** in Cirq.
- Introduction to **quantum measurements** and classical-quantum interactions.

### **Semester 2: Introduction to Quantum Computing**
In this semester, we delve deeper into quantum algorithms and more advanced topics such as:

1. **Quantum Teleportation** - Understanding quantum state transfer.
2. **Grover's Search Algorithm** - Quantum search optimization.
3. **Noisy Simulations and Benchmarking** - Studying quantum decoherence and error rates.
4. **Quantum Error Correction** - Introduction to error correction codes in quantum systems.
5. **Variational Algorithms** - Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.
6. **Quantum Networking** - Understanding quantum communications and networking principles.
