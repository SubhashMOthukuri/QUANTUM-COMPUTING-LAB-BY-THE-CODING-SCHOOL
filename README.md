Qubit X Qubit Quantum Computing Classes

Welcome to the Qubit X Qubit Quantum Computing Classes repository! This repository contains resources and learning materials for a two-semester course on Quantum Computing (QC) using Python and Cirq.

Course Overview

Semester 1: Foundations of Quantum Computing

In this semester, students will be introduced to Python programming and Cirq, a quantum computing framework. The curriculum covers fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics, quantum gates, and quantum circuits. The focus will be on understanding:

Basics of Python for quantum programming.

Introduction to Cirq and setting up a quantum development environment.

Understanding qubits, quantum superposition, and entanglement using light wave experiments.

Exploring quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli, CNOT, etc.).

Constructing and running quantum circuits in Cirq.

Introduction to quantum measurements and classical-quantum interactions.

Semester 2: Introduction to Quantum Computing

In this semester, we delve deeper into quantum algorithms and more advanced topics such as:

Quantum Teleportation - Understanding quantum state transfer.

Grover's Search Algorithm - Quantum search optimization.

Noisy Simulations and Benchmarking - Studying quantum decoherence and error rates.

Quantum Error Correction - Introduction to error correction codes in quantum systems.

Variational Algorithms - Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.

Quantum Networking - Understanding quantum communications and networking principles.
